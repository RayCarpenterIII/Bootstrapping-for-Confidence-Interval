1837,when on lifes ocean first i spread my sail  i then implored a mild auspicious gale  and from the slippery strand i took my flight  and sought the peaceful haven of delight  tyrannic storms arose upon my soul   and dreadful did their madning thunders roll the pensive muse was shaken from her sphere  and hope  it vanishd in the clouds of fear  at length a golden sun broke through the gloom  and from his smiles arose a sweet perfume  a calm ensued  and birds began to sing   and lo the sacred muse resumed her wing  with frantic joy she chaunted as she flew   and kissd the clement hand that bore her through her envious foes did from her sight retreat   or prostrate fall beneath her burning feet  twas like a proselyte  allied to heaven  or rising spirits boast of sins forgiven  whose shout dissolves the adamant away  whose melting voice the stubborn rocks obey  twas like the salutation of the dove   borne on the zephyr through some lonesome grove  when spring returns  and winters chill is past  and vegetation smiles above the blast  twas like the evening of a nuptial pair   when love pervades the hour of sad despair twas like fair helens sweet return to troy  when every grecian bosom swelled with joy  the silent harp which on the osiers hung  was then attuned  and manumission sung  away by hope the clouds of fear were driven  and music breathed my gratitude to heaven  hard was the race to reach the distant goal  the needle oft was shaken from the pole  in such distress who could forbear to weep tossed by the headlong billows of the deep  the tantalizing beams which shone so plain  which turned my former pleasures into pain which falsely promised all the joys of fame  gave way  and to a more substantial flame  some philanthropic souls as from afar  with pity strove to break the slavish bar to whom my floods of gratitude shall roll  and yield with pleasure to their soft control  and sure of providence this work begun he shod my feet this rugged race to run and in despite of all the swelling tide  along the dismal path will prove my guide  thus on the dusky verge of deep despair   eternal providence was with me there  when pleasure seemed to fade on lifes gay dawn  and the last beam of hope was almost gone

1845,friendship  thou balm for evry ill  i must aspire to thee whose breezes bid the heart be still  and render sweet the patients pill  and set the prisner free  friendship  it is the softest soul which feels anothers pain and must with equal sighs condole  while sympathetic streamlets roll which nothing can restrains  not to be nominated smart of mortals to be seen  she does not thus her gifts impart  her aid is from a feeling heart  a principle within  when the lone stranger  forced to roam  comes shivring to her door  at once he finds a weleome home   the torch of grace dispels his gloom  and bids him grope no more  friendship was never known to fail the voice of need to hear  when ruthless ills our peace assail   when from our hearts she draws the veil  aud drys the falling tear  when dogs and devils snarl and fight  she hides and dwells alone when friends and kindred disunite  with pity she surveys the right  and gives to each his own  friendship has not a sister grace her wonders to exceed she is the queen of all her race  whose charms the stoutest must embrace when in the vale of need  friendship is but the fecling sigh  the sympathizing tear   constraind to flow till others dry  nor lets the needy soul pass by  nor scorns to see or hear

1845,dear miss notwithstanding the cloud of doubts which overshadows the mind of adoring fancy  when i tace that vermillion cheek  that sapphire eye of expressive softness  and that symmetrical form of grace  i am constrained to sink into a flood of admiration beneath those heavenly charms though  dear miss  it may be useless to introduce a multiplicity of blandishments  which might either lead you into a field cf confusion  or absorb the truth of affection in the gloom of doubts but the bell of adulation may be told from the distance of its echo  and cannot be heard farther than seen  dear miss  whatever may be the final result of my adventurous progress  i now feel a propensity to embark on the ocean of chance  and expand the sail of resolution in quest of the distant shore of connubial happiness with one so truly lovely though  my dearest  the thunders of parental aversion may inflect the guardian index of affection from its favorite star  the deviated needle recovers its course  and still points onwards to its native poll though the waves of calumny may reverberate the persevering mind of the sailing lover  the morning star of  hope directs him through the gloom of trial to the object of his choice  my brightest hopes are mixd with tears  like hues of light and gloom as when mid sunshine rain appears  love rises with a thousand fears   to pine and still to bloom when i have told my last fond tale in lines of song to thee  and for departure spread my sail  say  lovely princess  wilt thou fail to drop a tear for me  o  princess  should my votive strain salute thy ear no more  like one deserted on the main  i still shall gaze  alas but vain  on wedlocks flowry shore

1845,  with tears i leave these academic bowers  and cease to cull the scientific flowers with tears i hail the fair succeeding train  and take my exit with a breast of pain the fresh may trace these wonders as they smile the stream of science like the river nile  reflecting mental beauties as it flows  which all the charms of college life disclose this sacred current as it runs refines  whilst byron sings and shakspeares mirror shines  first like a garden flower did i rise  when on the college bloom i cast my eyes i strove to emulate each smiling gem  resolved to wear the classic diadem but when the freshmans garden breeze was gone around me spread a vast extensive lawn twas there the muse of college life begun  beneath the rays of eruditions sun  where study drew the mystic focus down  and lit the lamp of nature with renown there first i heard the epic thunders roll  and homers lightning darted through my soul hard was the task to trace each devious line  though locke and newton bade me soar and shine  i sunk beneath the heat of franklins blaze  and struck the notes of philosophic praise with timid thought i strove the test to stand  reclining on a cultivated land  which often spread beneath a college bower  and thus invoked the intellectual shower even that fond sire on whose depilous crown  the smile of courts and states shall shed renown now far above the noise of country strife  i frown upon the gloom of rustic life  where no pure stream of bright distinction flows  no mark between the thistle and the rose ones like a bird encaged and bare of food  borne by the fowler from his native wood  where sprightly oft he sprung from spray to spray  and cheerd the forest with his artless lay  or fluttered oer the purling brook at will   sung in the dale or soard above the hill such are the liberal charms of college life  where pleasure flows without a breeze of strife and such would be my pain if cast away  without the blooms of study to display  beware  ye college birds  again beware  and shun the fowler with his subtile snare nor fall as one from eden  stript of all the life and beauty of your native hall nor from the garden of your honor go  whence all the streams of fame and wisdom flow where brooding miltons theme purl sweet along with pope upon the gales of epic song where you may trace a bland demosthenes  whose oratoric pen neer fails to please and plato  with immortal cicero   and with the eloquence of horace glow there cull the dainties of a great ainsworth  who sets the feast of ancient language forth or glide with ovid on his simple stream  and catch the heat from virgils rural beam through addison you trace creations fire  and all the rapid wheels of time admire or pry with paleys theologic rays  and hail the hand of wisdom as you gaze  up murrays pleasant hill you strive to climb  to gain a golden suminit all sublime  and plod through conic sections all severe  which to procure is pleasure true and dear the
